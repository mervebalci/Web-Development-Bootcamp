We use Node.js to create APIs, and JSON is a key thing in APIs.
The name stands for “JavaScript Object Notation” and it’s derived from JavaScript, but it’s not JavaScript.

JSON is a file format that’s used to store and interchange data.
Data is stored in a set of key-value pairs.

{
    "name": "Efes",
    "age": 4
}

As you see, keys are wrapped in double quotes, a colon separates the key and the value,
 and the value can be of different types. Key-value sets are separated by a comma.

Spacing (spaces, tabs, new lines) does not matter in a JSON file. 
The above is equivalent to:
{"name": "Efes","age": 4}


Using JavaScript we can load data from JSON.
`JSON.parse()` takes a JSON string as its parameter, and returns an object that contains the parsed JSON:
const cat = `{ "name": "Efes", "age": 4 }`
const data = JSON.parse(me)

data    =>    Output will be {name: "Efes", age: 4}


JSON.stringify() takes a JavaScript object as its parameter, and returns a string that represents it in JSON:
JSON.stringify(data)    =>    Output will be "{"name":"Efes","age":4}"
