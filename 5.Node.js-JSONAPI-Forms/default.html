<!--
    Handling form submission with JavaScript

    One special form input field with type="submit" shows a button 
    that once clicked will send the form data to the server.

    By default, forms submit their content to a server-side endpoint, 
    which by default is the page URL itself.

    We can override this behavior by setting the action attribute of the form element, 
    using the HTML method defined by the method attribute, which defaults to GET:

    Upon clicking the submit input element, the browser makes a POST request 
    to the `/contact` URL on the same origin (protocol, domain, and port).
