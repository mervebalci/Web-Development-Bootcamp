Apart from the couple dozens of built-in modules, we can use 3rd party modules.
Node.js modules, also called npm packages.
Running a single command, using `npm`, we can ask Node.js to fetch packages other developers published.

People work on something, they package it in a specific format 
and upload it on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a code hosting platform. 
Then, they set up the package on [https://www.npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/), 
the site responsible for hosting Node.js packages.
In any project, you can now use that package through the Node.js utility called `npm`.

For example: npm install my-prime
Type this inside the terminal

        !!!  npm packages work like Python libraries !!!


To require this module into program, create an app.js file and add:
    const pr = require('my-prime')

    console.log(pr.isPrime(2))
    console.log(pr.isPrime(4))

Then run it withh node app.js inside the terminal.

If you get an error, there are 2 ways to fix it:
    1. Rename the app.js file as app.cjs and run node app.cjs inside the terminal (cjs means common js)
    2. Remove the "type": "module" line from package.json file as that enables ES modules syntax instead of require()
