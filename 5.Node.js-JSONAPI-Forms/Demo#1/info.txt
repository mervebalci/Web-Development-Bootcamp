Find Users on GitHub

In this demo, we'll create an application that uses the GitHub API to show information to the person using it. 
The API endpoints we'll use are public, so there is no authentication needed in this case.

The app itself is not very complex, but it will help us learn how to consume an API.

We'll use JavaScript without any framework.

The goal of the application is to
    1. Provide a search form we can use to ask GitHub for some data about a specific user
    2. We enter a specific GitHub username, hit enter and we will ask the GitHub API for information about this user
    3. We'll show the user information on the screen
