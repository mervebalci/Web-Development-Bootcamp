Node comes with many built-in modules, such as 'fs', 'path', 'os'.

The `fs` module provides a lot of very useful functionality 
to access and interact with the file system.
There is no need to install it. Being part of the Node core, it can be used by requiring it:
    const fs = require('fs')

The particular thing about built-in modules is that no need to install them as 3rd party node modules, 
just require it and will have access to the functionality it provides.

So with requiring 'fs', you have access to all its methods:
    - `fs.copyFile()`: copies a file
    - `fs.mkdir()`: create a new folder
    - `fs.readFile()`: read the content of a file
    - `fs.rename()`: rename a file or folder
    - `fs.rmdir()`: remove a folder
    - ...and many more.
