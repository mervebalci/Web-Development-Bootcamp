<!-- 
Note that some fields have the required attribute.
If you click the "Save" button, the browser will tell you that the field was not filled, 
and will not submit the form until you provide a value. 

This is called **frontend** **validation**.

Forms are an extremely important part of HTML and the Web Platform.
They allow users can interact with the page and
    - sign up and log in
    - search for something on the site
    - trigger filters to trim result pages
    - send information
and much much more.
