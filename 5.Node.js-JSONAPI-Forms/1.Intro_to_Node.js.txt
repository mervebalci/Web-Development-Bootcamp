    ##    What is Node.js in simple terms?   ##

Node.js is a runtime, a tool, that allows us to run JavaScript outside of the browser.
This means we can use JavaScript to run programs that run on our computers, or on servers.

Node.js also powers most of the JavaScript tooling.

It’s worth noting that in the frontend, inside the browser, the only language we can use natively is JavaScript.
That’s the only language the browser knows. 

But on the server, we could use any language. Ruby, PHP, Python.. the list is long.

JavaScript however is a great choice because instead of learning multiple languages, 
you can learn JavaScript and use it everywhere. There’s less context switching.
You can get very good at JavaScript and be proficient with it in both frontend and backend.
