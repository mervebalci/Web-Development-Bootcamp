// Creating a model... The model is a representation of a database table.
// Prisma needs to know what fields a table has, and the types of them.

model Car {
  id         Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  brand      String
  model      String
  created_at DateTime @default(now())
  bought     Boolean  @default(false)
}

// This model defines 5 fields: id, brand, model, created_at, bought, each with its type, be it Int, String, DataTime, or Boolean.
// `id` has the `@id` attribute which means it's the **primary key**, which tells the database management system to make it unique. 
// And it defaults to a value that's automatically incremented, so whenever we add one new item, it always have a unique integer number that increments: 1, 2, 3, 4...

// NOTE: all fields are by default mandatory (from SQL, it means NOT NULL).
// To make a field optional, you can add a '?' after the type, like this:
// model String?
// age Int?
