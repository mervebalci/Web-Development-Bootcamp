In this demo, we’ll use
    - mouse events
    - event handlers
    - callback functions
    - the Selectors API
and more!

The goal of the demo is simple.
We’ll build a very simple example of a counter.
We are going to have a simple web page with a button, and we’ll have a counter that starts at 0.
Each time the button is clicked, we increment the counter.
