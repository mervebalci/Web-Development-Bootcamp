Previously, we worked on a demo project that used the DOM API to ask GitHub for a user’s data.
We’ll do the same project, but this time instead of using the DOM API we’ll use React.

We will
    - create a form
    - wait for the user to type in a GitHub username
    - ask the GitHub API for the user's public information
    - show a nice user card.
