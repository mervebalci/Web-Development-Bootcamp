DEMO #1 - COUNTER

In this demo, weâ€™ll build a very simple example of a counter.
We are going to have a simple web page with 4 buttons, and a place where we show the count.
The count starts at zero, and the buttons we'll add will increment the count by 1, 10, 100, or 1000 depending on which button is pressed.
We're going to associate one of these values with a button, and we will show it in the button text.
