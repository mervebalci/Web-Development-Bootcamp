<html>
    <head>
        <!-- The `head` tag contains special tags that define the document properties.
            It's always written before the `body` tag, right after the opening `html` tag.
            We never use attributes on this tag. And we don't write content in it. It's just a container for other tags.
            Inside it we can have a wide variety of tags, depending on what you need to do:
            - `title`
            - `script`
            - `link`
            - `style`
            - `meta` -->


        <!-- The title tag determines the page title. The title is displayed in the browser.  -->
        <title>The page title</title>


        <!-- This tag is used to add JavaScript to the page.
            You can include it inline, using an opening tag, the JavaScript code, and then the closing tag: -->
        <script>
            alert('This is an alert box!')
        </script>

        <script src="file.js"></script>

        <!-- <script src="https://server.com/file.js"></script> -->


        <!-- The link tag is mainly used to link an external CSS file. -->
        <link href="file.css" rel="stylesheet" />
        
        <!-- We can also link to resources other than stylesheets.
            For example, we can associate a favicon, the icon displayed in the tab of your browser: -->
        <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/assets/favicon-32x32.png" />


        <!-- The style tag can be used to add CSS styles to the document, rather than loading an external stylesheet. -->
        <style>
            p {
              color: red;
            }
        </style>

        <!-- OR you can put it in a separate style.css file and then load it in the HTML head: -->
        <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />

        <!-- This is more common when you have lots of CSS, which is what happens normally.
            CSS in the `head` of the HTML document works until a certain level, then it’s too painful to manage.
            Another way, useful for “quick fixes”, is to use the `style` attribute on an HTML element: -->
        <p style="color: yellowgreen">color test</p>


        <!-- Meta tags perform a variety of tasks. They are self-closing tags. 
            The most basic one is the `description` meta tag: -->
        <meta name="description" content="A nice page" />

        <!-- The charset meta tag is used to set the page character encoding, 
            which in the western world is typically set to utf-8 (but you might have another encoding in your country): -->
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <!-- There are many other meta tags, that provide other kinds of functionality, like social media cards, 
            information for search engines, and more.  -->
    </head>



    <body>
        <!-- Before looking at tags, we need to separate them into 2 categories: block elements and inline elements.
            Block elements (`p`, `div`, heading elements, lists and list items, and others) when positioned on the page 
            do not allow other elements to be visualized next to them.
            Inline elements instead can sit next to other inline elements.
            Another difference is that inline elements can be contained in block elements. The reverse is not true. -->
        
            <!-- The p tag defines a paragraph of text, and it's a block element: -->
        <p>A paragraph of text</p>

        <!-- Inside a `p` tag, we can add any inline element we like, like `span`. The `span` tag is an inline tag: -->
        <p>A part of the text <span>and here another part</span></p>
        <!-- We cannot add other block elements into a `p` or `span` tag. We cannot nest a `p` element into another one, as `p` is a block tag. -->


        <!-- All headings are block elements. They cannot contain other tags, except tags that identify text such as a span or strong. -->
        <h1>h1 heading size</h1>
        <h2>h2 heading size</h2>
        <h3>h3 heading size</h3>
        <h4>h4 heading size</h4>
        <h5>h5 heading size</h5>
        <h6>h6 heading size</h6>
        <p>Paragraph size</p>


        <!-- Unordered lists are created using the ul tag. Each item in the list is created with the li tag: -->
        <ul>
            <li>First item</li>
            <li>Second item</li>
            <li>Third item</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Ordered lists are similar, just made with the ol tag: -->
        <ol>
            <li>First</li>
            <li>Second</li>
            <li>Third</li>
        </ol>
    </body>



    <body>
        <!-- The opening tag of an element can have special snippets of information we can attach, called attributes.
            Attributes have the `key="value"` syntax: -->
        <p class="a-class">A paragraph of text</p>
        <p class="a-class" id="an-id">A paragraph of text</p>

        <!-- Some attributes are boolean, meaning you only need the key, for example, see the defer attribute on the script tag: -->
        <script defer src="file.js"></script>

        <!-- The `class` and `id` attributes are two of the most common you will find used.
            They have a special meaning, and they are useful both in CSS and JavaScript.
            The difference between the two is that an `id` is unique in the context of a web page; it cannot be duplicated.
            Classes, on the other hand, can appear multiple times on multiple elements.
            Plus, an `id` is just one value. `class` can hold multiple values, separated by a space: -->
        <p class="a-class another-class">
            A paragraph of text
        </p>
        <!-- It's common to use the dash - to separate words in a class value. -->

        <!-- We can select elements with a class using this syntax: .class {} -->
        <p class="dog-name">Roger</p>

        <!-- To select elements with a specific id, we can use this syntax: #id {} -->
        <p id="dog-name">Roger</p>

        <!-- You can target an element that has 2 (or more) classes together by combining the class names separated with a dot, without spaces. -->
        <p class="dog-name roger">Roger</p>

        <!-- In the same way, you can combine a class and an id. -->
        <p class="dog-name" id="roger">Roger</p>
    </body>



    <body>
        <!-- You can create a more specific selector by combining multiple items to follow the document tree structure.
            For example, if you have a span tag nested inside a p tag, you can target that one without applying the style to a span tag not included in a p tag: -->
        <span> Hello! </span>
        <p>
            My dog's name is:
            <span class="dog-name"> Roger </span>
        </p>
        <!-- This works even if the element on the right is multiple levels deep. -->


        <!-- To make the dependency strict to the first level, you can use the > symbol between the two tokens: 
            In this case, if a `span` is not a first children of the `p` element, it's not going to have the new color applied.
            Direct children will have the style applied: -->
        <p>
            <span> This is yellow </span>
            <strong>
                <span> This is not yellow </span>
            </strong>
        </p>


        <!-- Adjacent sibling selectors let us style an element only if preceded by a specific element. We do so using the + operator:
            This will assign the color orange to all span elements preceded by a p element: -->
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        <span>This is an orange span</span> <br>
    </body>



    <body>
        <!-- Links are defined using the a tag. The link destination is set via its href attribute. -->
        <a href="https://flaviocopes.com">
            click here
        </a> <br>

        <!-- Between the starting and closing tags, we have the link text.
            The above example is an absolute URL. Links also work with relative URLs: -->
        <a href="/test">click here</a>

        <!-- In this case, when clicking the link the user is moved to the `/test` URL on the current origin. 
            Be careful with the `/` character. If omitted, instead of starting from the origin, 
            the browser will just add the `test` string to the current URL.
            
            For example, suppose I’m visiting the page `https://flaviocopes.com/axios/` 
            and I have these 2 links (they don’t exist, it’s just an example):
            
            - the link `/test` does have a `/` prepending `test`, clicking brings me to `https://flaviocopes.com/test`.
            The `/` means “start from the root”
            - the link `test` does not have a `/` prepending `test`, so once clicked brings me to `https://flaviocopes.com/axios/test`
            
            Link tags can include other things inside them, not just text.
            For example, images can be links, too, so you click an image and you open a new page. -->
    </body>



    <body>
        <!-- Images can be displayed using the `img` tag. This tag accepts a `src` attribute, which we use to set the image source: -->
        <img src="image.png" />

        <!-- We can use a wide set of image formats on the Web. The most common ones are PNG, JPEG, GIF, SVG, and more recently WebP.
            The HTML standard requires an `alt` attribute to be present, to describe the image. 
            This is used by screen readers and also by search engine bots: -->
        <img src="dog.png" alt="A picture of a dog" />

        <!-- You can set the width and height attributes to set the space that the element will take
            so that the browser can account for it and does not change the layout when it's fully loaded.
            It takes a numeric value, expressed in pixels. -->
        <img src="dog.png" alt="A picture of a dog" width="350" height="200" />
    </body>



    <body>
        <!-- HTML provides us with some tags we can use to group other tags together.
            Suppose you want to group together a `<p></p>` and an `<img />`.
            You can use `<div></div>`. -->
        <div>
            <p>hello!</p>
            <img src="test.jpg" alt="an image" />
        </div>

        <!-- This is probably the most used tag. Other container tags exist.
            We have `section`, `article`, `header`, `aside`, `main`, `footer`, `nav`. Those are called semantic elements.
            They do not have any special style applied, they all work like `div` but their name has a specific meaning attached. -->
        <div>
            <div class="header">
                <h1>Title</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="article">
                <p>Article content</p>
            </div>
            <div class="footer">
                <p>Some footer info</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Or you can give those sections more meaning in this way, without using class attributes: -->
        <section>
            <header>
              <h1>Title</h1>
            </header>
            <article>
              <p>Article content</p>
            </article>
            <footer>
              <p>Some footer info</p>
            </footer>
        </section>
    </body>
