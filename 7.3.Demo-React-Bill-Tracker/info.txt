Demo #3 - TRACK YOUR BILLS

In this module, we're going to build a bill tracker application.

Every month you get a few bills (rent, internet, electricity, gas) 
and our goal here is to make a cool application that keeps track of them, written using React.

Hereâ€™s how the app will work:
    - When the app opens for the first time, it asks you to add your first bill category, like Electricity or Heating
    - After you add a category name, you can add your first bill for that category.
    - You add a few, then you can see all the bills together.
    - You can remove bills by clicking the `x` next to each one.
    - You can also add new categories by pressing the `+` button on the top right, 
      and clicking one category in the navigation filters bills by category


We will need:
  1. One component to enter a new category - AddCategory
  2. One component to display the categories list on top - NavBar
  3. One component to list the bills table - BillsTable
  4. One component to add a new bill - AddBill
